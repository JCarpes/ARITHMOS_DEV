# ARITHMOS_DEV

This is a RPA Project, using AutomationEdge as the primary tool for development.

The main goal here is avoid repetitive tasks that are usually made by human resources, allowing them to use their time on more valuable stuff to the company. 

The client is ARITHMOS, a brazilian accounting company. We are working on two scenarios here, both directed to fullfill brazilian government requisites called as DAS and Valor da Folha.

Reach out if you have any questions about it.
